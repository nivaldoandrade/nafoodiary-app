# NaFoodiary — Expo app

Expo SDK 57 / React Native 0.86 / React 19 / TypeScript strict. Expo APIs changed recently — read the versioned docs before writing code: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v57.0.0/

## Commands

- `yarn` (yarn.lock — do not use npm/pnpm)
- `yarn start` · `yarn ios` · `yarn android` · `yarn web`
- `yarn lint` — the only scripted check (`expo lint`). There is **no test suite and no typecheck script**; run `npx tsc --noEmit` for types.
- Web deploy: `yarn export:web` then `yarn serve:web` (output in `dist/`).

## Architecture

- Two-layer split with path aliases (defined in `tsconfig.json`): `@/app/*` → `src/app/*` (logic) and `@/ui/*` → `src/ui/*` (presentation). Entry: `index.ts` → `@/ui/App`.
- `src/app`: static `Service` subclasses share one axios client (`Service.ts`) with a 401→refresh interceptor; TanStack Query hooks in `hooks/queries` + `hooks/mutations`; `navigation/RootStack.tsx` switches Auth vs App stack on `isSignedIn` / `shouldShowOnboarding`; tokens persist via `AuthTokenManager` (AsyncStorage).
- `src/ui`: screens and components. Convention per feature folder: `index.tsx` + `styles.ts` + optional `use*.ts` hook + `schema.ts` (zod, paired with react-hook-form).
- Data flow: screen → `use*` hook → query/mutation hook → Service → axios. Toasts: import from `@/app/libs/sonner` (platform-split: `sonner` on web, `sonner-native` on native).

## Gotchas

- **Env vars**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` are read only through explicit property lists — `src/app/config/env.ts` (zod-parsed) and `useSocialAuth.ts`. Do not parse `process.env` wholesale; Metro must statically inline each var for production web export. Vars documented in `.env.example`.
- **Web + native parity is required** (web is the primary validation surface). `Platform.OS` branches already exist for date picker, video, toasts, file handling, animations — check them before adding platform-specific code. `DesktopGate` blocks web viewports wider than 480px.
- **Lint rules that differ from defaults** (`eslint.config.js`): interfaces must be `I`-prefixed (`IFoo`), single quotes, semicolons, always-multiline trailing commas, `curly: all`, `eqeqeq`, `no-console: warn`.
- Meal queries use `staleTime: Infinity` (manual refresh/pull-to-refresh is the model); `queryClient` has `retry: false`.
- Meal processing is async (`UPLOADING → QUEUED → PROCESSING → SUCCESS/FAILED`) — poll status, don't block on upload.
- `/ios` and `/android` are gitignored generated folders (`expo run:*` regenerates them); `.env` is gitignored.

## Product & design sources of truth

- `PRODUCT.md` — platform, users, capabilities, constraints.
- `DESIGN.md` — tokens, component specs, named rules (macro hues reserved for macros; spring lime is the only accent). UI work should follow these; the `impeccable` skill/command reads them.
- All user-facing copy is **Brazilian Portuguese**, friendly and non-judgmental voice.
- `CLAUDE.md` points here (`@AGENTS.md`) — keep a single source.
